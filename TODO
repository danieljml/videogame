To Do:

- Check how to lock the framerate
- Check SDL_CreateRenderer with SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC
- Create a new data structure to store the player's data, using floats to represent position and size, since it makes calculations easier
- Section: Physics
	- Every character has an acceleration on each axis
	- Every character has a number of jumps
	- Every character should be validated against some jumpable surface to check how it behaves
	- Every character should stick to the walls
- Use acceleration instead of fixed value for movement
- Create some vector to store the direction of the character
- Span a new entity when firing. In the direction the player is facing towards
- Collision system to avoid moving if there is some
- Gravity
- Terrain
- Tiles
- Declare Rects only when necessary
- How do I substitute the collision block?
- How does delay work on the lifecycle of the game?

Notes:

- roundf rounds to the nearest integer
